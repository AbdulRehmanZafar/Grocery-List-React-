# Grocery-List-React-
I recently created a simple grocery list app using React JS it lets you add items, check them off when done, search through your list, and even saves everything in localStorage so your list stays even after refreshing the page. This project helped me get more comfortable with React Hooks, breaking code into components, and handling form inputs.
